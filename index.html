    Hi, My name is Chocolate Chip. I have come a long way from my humble begining on a cocoa farm where I started as a cocoa bean. I was removed from my pod when it was fully ripe and then transported to a chocolate factory where I was cleaned and roasted. A lot has happened since then but I am happy to say that I am now a delicious chocolate chip ready for a delicious cookie.
